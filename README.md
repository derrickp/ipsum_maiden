## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Word List

The following sources served as inspiration. In the interest of making this appropriate for use in some specific contexts I've removed some words liable to cause more problematic combinations. That said, I wouldn't recommend using this at work unless your work is pretty metal.

- [this gist](https://gist.github.com/tomash/638477)
- [this excellent academic work](http://www.degeneratestate.org/posts/2016/Apr/20/heavy-metal-and-natural-language-processing-part-1/)
- [this list](http://www.invisibleoranges.com/the-100-most-overused-metal-band-name-words-according-to-metal-archives/)

If you want to use this in your project, but some of the words in the list are preventing you from doing so, please reach out to me. I'd rather see some cool uses of this project than have the most brutal list of words possible.
